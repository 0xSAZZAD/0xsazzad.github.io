<p>Passing the <strong>OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)</strong>  certification was more than just an achievement for me ‚Äî it was the realization of a dream I had nurtured since 2021. Looking back, the journey was full of challenges, late nights, and a lot of learning, but every step was worth it.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation-phase">The Preparation Phase</h2>
<p>The thought of achieving this certification stayed in my mind for years, but the timing was never right.</p>
<p>Fast forward to <strong>June 8, 2024</strong> ‚Äî the day I officially started my OSCP journey. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy, but I was ready to give it my all.</p>
<p>However, my journey wasn‚Äôt without challenges. On <strong>July 18, 2024</strong>, My country <em>Bangladesh</em> experienced an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/28/bangladesh-restores-mobile-internet-after-11-day-blackout-to-quell-protests">internet blackout</a> as student protests against the government jobs quota scheme turned violent. I was worried and wondering if I could complete my OSCP preparation in time! But After five days of a complete shutdown, the internet was fully restored on July 24, and I made up for the lost time by diving straight into the challenge labs. Despite the disruption, I managed to complete all of the challenge labs before my lab time expired. Balancing my preparation with my full-time job as a Jr. SOC Analyst was tough. However, my previous experience in pen testing and CTF was helpful. Here‚Äôs how I structured my preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Course &amp; Exercises</strong>: I&rsquo;ve read each chapter, taken notes and completed the exercises but didn&rsquo;t watch the videos.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Labs</strong>: I‚Äôve completed all the challenge labs and documented everything. Skylark took me a few days to complete.</li>
<li><strong>OSCP Like Boxes</strong>: I merged <strong>TJ Null‚Äôs</strong> and <strong>LainKusanagi‚Äôs</strong> OSCP Boxes lists into a single spreadsheet (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CDMZ3s2SFUxjMEYdFKOqRyX-lpqnhOohrxBdpVespEM/htmlview">here</a>) and solved all the boxes of Proving Grounds and HTB.</li>
<li><strong>CPTS Path</strong>:  In addition to the official course material, I‚Äôve also completed 50% of the <strong>Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)</strong> path from <a href="https://referral.hackthebox.com/mzwxxes">HackTheBox</a>, which complemented my learning and found beneficial.</li>
</ol>
<p>I learned that <strong>enumeration is key</strong>. If something didn‚Äôt work, it was often because I had missed a detail during enumeration.</p>
<h2 id="the-exam-day">The Exam Day</h2>
<p>I scheduled my exam on <strong>November 26, 2024</strong>. The OSCP exam is 23 hours and 45 minutes and it consists of an Active Directory network and 3 standalone machines, to achieve full points we have to gain root or administrative privilege. Following that, we are given an additional 24 hours to write and submit a detailed professional report.</p>
<p>I started with compromising AD, which took me around 3.5 hours. This boosted my confidence significantly. From there, I moved on to the other machines.</p>
<p>It took me around <strong>7 hours</strong> to achieve the pass mark. I took a few breaks in between. After reaching the pass mark, I began cross-checking my notes to ensure I hadn‚Äôt missed any critical details that would be necessary for writing a report.</p>
<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>Once the hacking phase was over, the work wasn‚Äôt done. Writing the report is just as critical as the hacking itself. I spent the next few hours carefully documenting every step I took, ensuring my explanations were clear and detailed. I treated this report as if I were presenting it to a client ‚Äî clear, concise, and professional.</p>
<p>On <strong>December 1, 2024</strong>, I received the email: <strong>‚ÄúOSCP Certification Exam Results‚Äù</strong> üéâ. Alhamdulillah all the hard work, sleepless nights, and perseverance had paid off.

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>Passing the OSCP in just <strong>five months</strong>, despite the challenges I faced, taught me several invaluable lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Perseverance Pays Off</strong>: There were moments when I felt stuck or frustrated, but pushing through those moments made all the difference.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation is Critical</strong>: Whether during the exam or in real-world engagements, keeping detailed notes is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: The knowledge I gained by solving from the challenge labs,  Proving Grounds, and Hack The Box was instrumental in my success.</li>
<li><strong>Never Stop Learning</strong>: The OSCP is just one step in a lifelong journey of learning and growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, I‚Äôm proud to say I&rsquo;m the <strong>first individual from Bangladesh</strong> to achieve the newly enhanched <strong>OSCP+ certification</strong>. It‚Äôs an honor and it motivates me to keep pushing the boundaries in cybersecurity.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>To anyone aspiring to take on the OSCP: You‚Äôve got this. Stay focused, put in the effort, and trust the journey ‚Äî every challenge is a step toward success. There will be tough moments, but remember: persistence is key. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and don‚Äôt be afraid to fail ‚Äî it‚Äôs all part of the process. Stay disciplined, stay motivated, and celebrate your progress along the way. Your dedication will pay off. <strong>You can do it!</strong></p>
